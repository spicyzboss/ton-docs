# Localization Program

The Translation Program is a collaborative effort to translate various documents related to TON into multiple languages, making the website more accessible to billions of non-English speakers worldwide.

## System Design Philosophy

The localization program is **launched** and **actively maintained** by [**TownSquare Labs**](https://github.com/TownSquareXYZ), one of the closest partners of **TON**.

We are committed to creating an open infrastructure for multilingual community collaboration to **advance TON to a better phase**, which includes:

* **Suitable for multilingual communities**   
   The program supports multiple languages, ensuring inclusivity and ease of access for users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

* **Automate development, integration, and deployment**  
   Through automation tools, the program simplifies development, integration, and deployment, reducing manual efforts and enhancing efficiency and consistency across localization efforts.

* **Separation of roles for developer, translator, and verifier**  
   Our approach divides the responsibilities of developers, translators, and verifiers, allowing each role to focus on their tasks, ensuring high-quality translations and seamless collaboration without role conflicts.

* **Incentives for community contributions**  
   We offer incentives for community members who contribute to localization efforts. This fosters active participation, rewards contributors, and promotes a sense of ownership and community engagement.

* **Advanced AI system integration**  
   AI systems improve translation accuracy and efficiency by offering intelligent suggestions and automating repetitive tasks, ensuring high-quality outcomes with reduced effort.

This project is designed to support speakers of multiple languages, with the goal of serving the global developer ecosystem.
