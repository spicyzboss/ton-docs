# How to Contribute

## Identify area for contribution

There are several ways to identify the area where you can contribute to TON Docs:

- Join [TON Docs Club chat](https://t.me/+c-0fVO4XHQsyOWM8) in Telegram and get the latest tasks from maintainers.
- If you have a specific contribution in mind but are unsure about it, confirm whether
  the contribution is appropriate by contacting one of the [Docs maintainers](/v3/contribute/maintainers) directly.
- Get familiar with the most frequently asked questions in the [TON Developers](https://t.me/tondev_eng) chats.
- Please read over the [issues](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/issues) in the GitHub repository.
- Learn available [footsteps](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues?q=documentation) for the documentation.

## TL;DR

- If you need to add or edit something in TON Docs, create a pull request 
  against the `main` branch.
- The documentation team will review the pull request or reach out as needed.
- Repository: https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs

## Development

### Online one-click contribution setup

You can use Gitpod (a free, online, VS code-like IDE) for contributing. It will launch a workspace with a single click and will automatically:

### Code Conventions

- **Most important**: look around. Match the overall style of the project. This includes formatting, naming files, naming objects in code, naming things in documentation, and so on.
- **For documentation**: When editing documentation, do not wrap lines at 80 characters; instead, configure your editor to soft-wrap.
- **Grammar**: `cpell` will check the spelling and suggest corrections in case of mistakes automatically before creating new commit. Feel free to add specific `words` to `cspell.json` config to include them in the verification dictionary.

Don't worry too much about styles in general; the maintainers will help you fix them as they review your code.

### Pull Requests

So you have decided to contribute code back to upstream by opening a pull request. You've put in a lot of effort, and we appreciate it. We will do our best to work with you and get the pull request reviewed. 

When submitting a pull request, please ensure the following:

1. **Keep your pull request small**. Smaller pull requests (~300 lines of diff) are easier to review and more likely to get merged. Make sure the pull request does only one thing, otherwise please split it.
2. **Use descriptive titles**. It is recommended to follow the commit message style.
3. **Test your changes**. Describe your test plan in your pull request description.

All pull requests should be opened against the `main` branch.

## What Happens Next?

The TON Docs team will be monitoring pull requests. Please help us by following the guidelines above to keep the pull requests consistent.
