# TVM Exit codes

If TVM exits with an arbitrary 16-bit unsigned integer `exit_code`. `exit_code`  higher than 1, it is considered an _error code_. Therefore, an exit with such a code may cause the transaction to revert or bounce.

## Standard exit codes

:::info
The list of standard exit codes contains all universal TVM exit codes defined for the TON Blockchain. Alternative exit codes should be sought in the source code of the corresponding contract.

|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0`       | Compute Phase | Standard successful execution exit code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `1`       | Compute Phase | Alternative successful execution exit code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `2`       | Compute Phase | Stack underflow. The last op-code consumed more elements than there are on the stacks. <sup>1</sup>                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `3`       | Compute Phase | Stack overflow. More values have been stored on a stack than are allowed by this version of TVM.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `4`       | Compute Phase | Integer overflow. Integer does not fit into −2<sup>256</sup> ≤ x < 2<sup>256</sup> or a division by zero has occurred.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `5`       | Compute Phase | Integer is out of expected range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `6`       | Compute Phase | Invalid opcode. The instruction is unknown in the current TVM version.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `7`       | Compute Phase | Type check error. An argument to a primitive has an incorrect value type. <sup>1</sup>                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `8`       | Compute Phase | Cell overflow. Writing to the builder is not possible since after operation there would be more than 1023 bits or 4 references.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `9`       | Compute Phase | Cell underflow. The read operation from slice primitive tried to read more bits or references than available.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `10`      | Compute Phase | Dictionary error. An error during manipulation with the dictionary (hashmaps).                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `11`      | Compute Phase | Most often caused by trying to call get-method whose id wasn't found in the code (missing `method_id` modifier or wrong get-method name specified when trying to call it). In [TVM docs](https://ton.org/tvm.pdf) its described as "Unknown error, may be thrown by user programs". | 
| `12`      | Compute Phase | Thrown by TVM in situations considered impossible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `13`      | Compute Phase | Out of gas error. Thrown by TVM when the remaining gas turns negative.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `-14`     | Compute Phase | This indicates an out of gas error, the same as code `13`. It is negative because  it [cannot be faked](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/20758d6bdd0c1327091287e8a620f660d1a9f4da/crypto/vm/vm.cpp#L492)                                                                  |
| `32`      | Action Phase  | Action list is invalid. Set during the action phase if c5 register after execution contains unparsable object.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `-32`     | Action Phase  | (the same as prev 32) - Method ID not found. Returned by TonLib during an attempt to execute non-existent get method.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `33`      | Action Phase  | The action list is too long.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `34`      | Action Phase  | Action is invalid or not supported. Set during the action phase if current action cannot be applied.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `35`      | Action Phase  | Invalid Source address in the outbound message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `36`      | Action Phase  | Invalid Destination address in the outbound message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `37`      | Action Phase  | Not enough TON. The message sends too much TON, or there isn't enough TON remaining after deducting fees.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `38`      | Action Phase  | Not enough extra-currencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `40`      | Action Phase  | Not enough funds to process the message. This error is thrown when there is only enough gas to partially cover the message, but not enough to cover it completely.                                                                                                                  |
| `43`      | Action Phase  | The maximum number of cells in the library has been exceeded, or the maximum depth of the Merkle tree has been surpassed.                                                                                                                                                           |

<sup>1</sup> If you encounter such exception in a func contract it probably means a type error in asm declarations.

:::info
Often you can see the exit code `0xffff` (65535 in decimal form). This usually means that the received opcode is unknown to the contract. When writing contracts, this code is set by the developer himself.
